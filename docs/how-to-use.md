# How to use

# Compiling on RISC-V hardware

Simply compile felix86 with CMake

Run these from the base directory of felix86:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

# Testing on other architectures

Since RISC-V hardware is not up to par when it comes to both speed and extensions, it's desirable sometimes to use your more powerful hardware
to run felix86 for debugging or testing purposes.

[Spike](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim) seems like a good candidate to emulate felix86, however the proxy kernel it requires seems quite incomplete.

Currently to test felix86 I use qemu-riscv and run an Ubuntu image.

This works fine for me: (change the cores/RAM to your liking)
Make sure the disk image has enough space to compile.
```bash
qemu-system-riscv64 \
-machine virt -m 8192 -smp 10 \
-cpu rv64,v=true,vlen=128,vext_spec=v1.0,zacas=true,zam=true,zabha=true,zba=true,zbb=true,rvv_ta_all_1s=true,rvv_ma_all_1s=true \
-bios /usr/share/qemu/opensbi-riscv64-generic-fw_dynamic.bin \
-kernel /usr/share/u-boot-qemu-bin/qemu-riscv64_smode/uboot.elf \
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=eth0 -netdev user,id=eth0 \
-device virtio-rng-pci \
-drive file=ubuntu-24.04.1-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img,format=raw,if=virtio
```

## RootFS

felix86 requires an x86-64 "rootfs" which is the filesystem at the root directory on Linux.

The way to get the rootfs varies for each distro, for Ubuntu you can use the following link:
- [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/)

After acquiring the rootfs, you need to supply felix86 with the path to the rootfs directory using the `-p` parameter.

After providing the path you can add more optional arguments and finish it with the path to the binary you want to emulate and
any arguments you want to pass.

The binary **must** be inside the rootfs directory, so place it anywhere in there.

Example:
`./felix86 -p /home/myuser/myrootfs /home/myuser/myrootfs/MyApplication arg1 arg2 arg3`

By default, no environment variables are passed to the executable.

Use `--help` to view all the options.

# Compiling tests

Set `BUILD_TESTS` to 1/ON/whatever else CMake requires as true.

Run `felix86_test` to run every test, or `felix86_test "the test name"` to run a specific test.

Also try `felix86_test --help`, it uses Catch2.
